        Step 2A: Create Installer 1 Package
        ====================================================================================================
        
        The path to the msi file is built using the two variables created automatically by WiX when the bundle
        references the MSI projects from the same Visual Studio solution:
            - Installer1.TargetDir
            - Installer1.TargetName
        
        The property "MESSAGE" is set to the value from the bundle's variable "Message".
        Notice the square brackets used to specify the variable.
        
        Go To: Installer2Package.wxs
